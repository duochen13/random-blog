      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I'm currently a master student studying computer science at Columbia, I finished my CS bachelor at Umich and used to intern at TikTok, ServiceNow and Genemod. </p>
      <p>The time at Ann Arbor was busy but fulfilling, I was a member of MDP (Multidisciplinary Design Program), collaborated with business team and researchers, working on building anonymous secure communicaiton app.</p>
      <p>During my sophomore year, I worked at Genemod in Seattle and building the full-stack app called Freezer, which helps researchers facilitates the process of tracking chemical reagents in the biochemical lab.</p>
      <p>During my junior year, I worked at ServiceNow, form-control team to help build react-like web components, I learned how sprint planning, Dev and QA cycle works, and how much effort and time can take to merge a small feature to a huge codebase. Also I participated the ServiceNow hackathon and met some great friends, we built a voice based SQL executor and surprisingly, the project went to the final round and we managed to present it to VPs within the company.</p>
      <p>After interning at an early-stage start-up and ToB software company, I tried to seek more interesting work with relative broader scope, thus I chose to intern at TikTok, backend engineering team at Mountain View office, specifically video caption team. I helped build the video caption metadata microservice mainly using Gin and Kite (Golang frameworks) which can take over 500 QPS from TikTok upstream core services.</p>
      <p>In my square time, I would like to build toy projects and read engineering blogs (My favorite ones are Stripe's and Uber's), I'm also interested in designing and building large-scale distributed system and cloud computing.</p>
